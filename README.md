## Simple Work Day Scheduler

### Introduction
Hello my name is Brennan, I've created this simple workday scheduler. It uses moment JS, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JQuery. This project was designed for U.C. Davis coding bootcamp.

### Description
This project allows you to input tasks you will be doing throughout the day. It highlights areas red for time that has already pasted, grey for the current time, and green for time that is coming up that is available. Using Moment JS it displays the current time and date at the top of the page, and allows you to store your to-do tasks into the local storage.

### Installation
This scheduler is very easy to impliment for yourself. All you need to do it navigate to the page, and imput your to do's for the day into the availble time slots. Alternatively you can go to my github, open the corrasponding project, and launch it from the URL displayed.

### Thanks
Thank you for viewing my project, I hope it helps you plan your day in a more orderly fashion!
